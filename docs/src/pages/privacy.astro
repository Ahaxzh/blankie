          I maintain this privacy policy not just because it's required to be
          part of Apple's ecosystem but because I strongly believe in
          transparency. To put it plainly, your information never leaves your
          computer. The Blankie app doesn't connect to the internet, collect
          analytics, or track you in any way. When you use a version of Blankie
          distributed through Apple's platforms, Apple may provides us with some
          basic anonymous statistics about downloads and crashes, but the app
          itself (whether from GitHub or the App Store) never collects or
          transmits any data directly back to Blankie's developers. The formal
          policy below explains this in more detail, but that's really all there
          is to it. â€”@codybrom

      <strong>Effective Date</strong>: April 28, 2025
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      Your privacy is important to us. Blankie itself does not collect, store,
      or share any personal information and there are no tracking or analytics
      frameworks implemented in the app as part of the source code.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      When you get Blankie through the Mac App Store or join our public
      TestFlight beta, Apple may collect some usage data (as explained in their
      privacy policy). Apple never shares your personal information with us
      unless you explicitly give it to us.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      From time to time, some contributors may be granted access to private
      internal TestFlight betas. For these private betas, we need to share your
      email address with Apple so they can send you an invitation. This email
      address is only used for the TestFlight invitation process and is not
      shared with anyone else.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      Apple also shares with us basic anonymous statistics about how many people
      downloaded the app and if it crashes. We use this information to make
      Blankie more stable and reliable. You can learn more about Apple's data
      collection in their

    <ul class="text-mid-gray list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Information You Provide</strong>: If you choose to contribute
        code or translations to the Blankie project and also choose to share
        your name or email address with us, we may use them to either credit or
        contact you. You do not need to share your name or email address with us
        to contribute to the project (communicating publicly via GitHub issues
        and discussions is actually our preference) and we will never sell your
        information or use it for any other purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Data Collection in App</strong>: The Blankie app never asks
        for, or stores any personal data such as names, emails, or physical
        addresses. This is true whether you download the app from the Blankie
        website, from GitHub or from Apple's platforms. Blankie never collects
        or transmits any data back to the developers and any statistics we
        receive come solely from Apple's platform services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Third-Party Analytics</strong>: Blankie does not include any
        analytics frameworks or trackers in the app or on this website.

      Data Sharing and Disclosure
    </h2>
    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      Since we do not collect any data, we cannot share anything with any third
      party. However, if you download through Apple's platforms, please refer to
      Apple's privacy policy regarding their data collection practices.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Updates</h2>
    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      While Blankie will always remain privacy-focused, Apple's requirements and
      other legal standards may evolve. If we need to update this policy to
      reflect such changes, you'll find the latest version here. Our commitment
      to privacy won't change.
