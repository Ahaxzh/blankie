# Usage

## Installing and Running

1. **Download** the latest `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/releases).
2. **Copy** the app to your Applications folder.
3. **Open** Blankie and click a sound to start!

## Basics of Controlling Blankie

- **Play/Pause:** The main play/pause button (the bigger play/pause icon) at the bottom center of the main window will toggle all currently selected sounds on or off simultaneously.
- **Volume**: In addition to the individual sound sliders, there is a global slider available from the controls bar (click the speaker icon to the left of the Play/Plause button), that's handy for blending Blankie's soundscapes with other apps.
- **Presets**: You can save and load different sets of active/inactive sounds and volumes. The dropdown menu for presets will not appear until you save your first preset using the menu button next to the Play/Pause button.

## Advanced Options

- **Hide Inactive Sounds:** In the vertical ellipses menu, you can choose to toggle the "Hide Inactive Sounds" setting. This will hide any sounds that are not active, giving you a cleaner and smaller list of sounds to look at.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** You can trigger main app functionalities, such as the play/pause button and the preferences window, using main shortcuts. The full list of these shortcuts is visible in a "Keyboard Shortcuts" panel, available in the Titlebar menu.
- **Preferences:** You can customize the way Blankie looks and autoplay on startup behavior in the "Preferences" area, available from the Settings menu in your mac's menubar under Blankie, or from the titlebar menu.
